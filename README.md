# Software Engineering Final Course Project
## Made By:
- Colotti Manuel Enrique
- Colella Edoardo
- Bianchi Giulia
- Di Benedetto Giovanna

For this software engineering project we designed a Warehouse Management System following a Waterfall approach.
At the end of the development phase we also implemented Unit and Integration tests to verify the correctness of our work.
What we obtained at the end was a fully functioning warehouse management system that was evaluated with the highest possible score.

All the produced design artifact can be found inside the root folder of the project:

- Requirements Document
- Design Document
- GUI Prototype
- Estimation Document
- API Document
- Unit Test Report
- API Test Report
