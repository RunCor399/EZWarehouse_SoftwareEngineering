# Project Estimation  
Date: 08/04/2022

Version: 1.0


# Estimation approach
Consider the EZWH  project as described in YOUR requirement document, assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course
# Estimate by size
### 
|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   |      25 (model) + 30 (interfaces + abstract) + 10 (view) + 25(Controller) = 90 |          
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       |         200 LOC                   | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) | 90 * 200 = 18000 |
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours   |   18000 / 10 = 1800                                   |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) | 1800 * 30 = 54000 | 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |    11,25 weeks           |
